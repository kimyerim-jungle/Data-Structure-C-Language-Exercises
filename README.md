Brief Introduction
----------
Exercises of C Language Programming & Exercises of Data Structure using C Language. 

**70** questions about C language Programming, **30** questions about Linked List/Stack n Queue/Binary Tree/Binary Search Tree. Some functions like *POP/PUSH/DEQUEUE/ENQUEUE* have been set for you in advance.

Project Details
----------
The questions are picked from **Nanyang Technological University's Online Judge System** or what so called **Automated Programming Assessment System (APAS)** of NTU. The answers here are written by me which may **NOT** be the same as the university's model answer. Please feel free to report any bugs that you find in my codes or questions. I will fix them as soon as possible.

The face-to-face lectures are held by Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. Course Number is **CZ1007**. Lectures are of free access to all students. The use of APAS is limited to registered students of CZ1007 currently.

Future Prospect
----------
During this summer I may collect more questions on algorithm & deep learning. That will be new repositories. I just write to notify.

Statement of Rights and Responsibilities
----------
***The partial pictures and some sets of information are the university collection. If there is any infringement of rights, please kindly inform us. We will delete that part in one business day.***

The answers provided here are all writen by me (except a few BST questions) which may not guarantee 100% correct. If you want the official answers, please kindly approach to the course lecturers or corresponding lab tutors.
